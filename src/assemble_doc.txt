This is the simple documentation I maintain for the assembler.

1. Tokenizer

func tokenize:
	INPUT: A line having the literals.
	OUTPUT: All the tokens in form of a struct INSTRUCTION.

struct instruction:
	label: label to the line, if any.
	mnemonic: operation to be performed.
	op1: First operand.
	op2: Second operand.
	op3: Third operand.
	op4: Fourth operand.

2. Instructions

func key_to_int:
	INPUT: Enter the string and the dictionary number.
	OUTPUT: Returns the int associated with the string in the dictionary.

func instr_dpi:
	INPUT: struct instruction.
	OUTPUT: Machine code for Data Processing Instruction.

func instr_multiply:
	INPUT: struct instruction.
	OUTPUT: Machine code for Multiply Instruction.

func instr_sdt:
	INPUT: struct instruction.
	OUTPUT: Machine code for Simple Data Transfer Instruction.

func instr_branch:
	INPUT: struct instruction.
	OUTPUT: Machine code for the Branch Instruction.
